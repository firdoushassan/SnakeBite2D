This project is a classic 2D Snake Game built using Java's Swing framework. The game allows players to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes frogs, while avoiding collisions with itself. The gameplay is smooth and includes sound effects to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Eat frogs to grow the snake.
- **Responsive Controls:** Use the arrow keys(W,A,S,D) to control the snake's direction.
- **Simple Graphics:** Basic 2D game design using Java Swing for easy rendering.
- **Sound Effects:** Integrated sound effects to make the gameplay more engaging.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
- Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/firdoushassan/SnakeBite2D

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   cd SnakeBite2D

3. **Compile the Java files:**
   You can compile the game using the terminal or your IDE. For example, in the terminal:
   javac Main.java GamePanel.java Sound.java

4. **Run the Game:**
   Once compiled, run the main class to start the game:
    java Main


## How to Play
- Use the following keys to control the snake's movement (up(W), down(S), left(A), right(D)).
- The goal is to eat the frogs that appears randomly on the screen to grow the snake.
- The speed of the snake will keep on increasing as it eats the frogs.
- Be careful! If the snake runs into itself, the game will be over.

## Sound Effects
Sound effects are included in the game to create a more immersive experience. You can modify or add additional sounds by editing the `Sound.java` class.

**I AM STILL WORKING ON THE PROJECT FROM TIME TO TIME TO ADD MORE FEATURES LIKE MORE ADVANCED ANIMATIONS AS WELL AS A LEVEL SYSTEM. CURRENTLY THE GAME DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY LEVELS. HOPEFULLY I WILL ADD THEM IN THE FUTURE**
